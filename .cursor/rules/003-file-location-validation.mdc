      Before creating or modifying files:

      1. For Project Structure:
         - Reference @project-context.md for application directory structure
         - Follow established patterns in existing directories
         - Consult tech stack documentation for framework-specific conventions

      2. For Documentation and Rules:
         - Cursor Rules: See @000-cursor-rules-location.mdc
         - Memory Management: See @010-docs-memory-knowledge-management.mdc
         - File Naming: See @002-rule-file-naming.mdc

      CRITICAL REMINDER:
      - ALWAYS check relevant documentation before file creation
      - NEVER duplicate directory structure documentation
      - ALWAYS reference existing rules and documentation
      - When in doubt, consult the referenced files above

examples:
  - input: "Creating a new component"
    output: "Check @project-context.md for component location"
    explanation: "Project structure defines components should be in app/components"

  - input: "Adding a new rule"
    output: "Check @000-cursor-rules-location.mdc and @002-rule-file-naming.mdc"
    explanation: "Rule location and naming conventions are defined in existing rules"
