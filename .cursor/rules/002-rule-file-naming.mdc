# Cursor Rule File Naming

## Context
- Ensures consistent and organized rule file naming
- Facilitates easy discovery and maintenance of rules
- Enables automated validation and categorization
- Supports future scalability of the rule system

## Rule Definition

<rule>
name: rule_file_naming
description: Ensures cursor rule files follow consistent naming conventions with proper numbering and kebab-case format

filters:
  - type: file_extension
    pattern: "\\.mdc$"

      Rule files should follow these naming conventions:

      ## Category Ranges and Purpose

      1. User Managed Rules (000-049):
         - Personal customizations
         - Project-specific rules
         - Team conventions
         Example: `001-team-coding-standards.mdc`

      2. Global Rules (050-099):
         - Core system rules
         - Git and version control
         - Documentation standards
         Example: `050-conventional-commits.mdc`

      3. Build Rules (100-199):
         - CI/CD workflows
         - Deployment processes
         - Build configurations
         Example: `100-docker-build-standards.mdc`

      4. Infrastructure Rules (200-299):
         - Database schemas
         - API design patterns
         - Service configurations
         Example: `200-prisma-schema-standards.mdc`

      5. Backend Rules (300-499):
         - API endpoints
         - Authentication
         - Data validation
         Example: `300-api-endpoint-standards.mdc`

      6. Frontend Rules (500-699):
         - Component patterns
         - State management
         - UI/UX standards
         Example: `500-react-component-standards.mdc`

      7. Miscellaneous (900-999):
         - Utility functions
         - Third-party tools
         - Cross-cutting concerns
         Example: `900-utility-patterns.mdc`

      8. AI Created Rules (1000+):
         - Learned patterns
         - User corrections
         - Automated improvements
         Example: `1000-ai-learned-pattern.mdc`

      ## Naming Guidelines

      1. Format Requirements:
         - Three-digit or four-digit prefix (category identifier)
         - Hyphen separator
         - Descriptive kebab-case name
         - Lowercase .mdc extension
         Example: `042-my-custom-rule.mdc`

      2. Name Components:
         - Category prefix: [0-9]{3} OR [0-9]{4}
         - Separator: Single hyphen
         - Description: [a-z0-9-]+
         - Extension: .mdc

      3. Length Constraints:
         - Minimum: 5 characters
         - Maximum: 50 characters
         - Excludes file extension

      4. Prohibited:
         - Uppercase letters
         - Consecutive hyphens
         - Special characters
         - Reserved words

examples:
  - input: "042-my-custom-rule.mdc"
    output: "Valid user managed rule"
    explanation: "Proper category (042), kebab-case, descriptive name"

  - input: "050-git-commit-standards.mdc"
    output: "Valid global rule"
    explanation: "Proper category (050), describes purpose clearly"

  - input: "500-react-hooks-patterns.mdc"
    output: "Valid frontend rule"
    explanation: "Proper category (500), specific to frontend patterns"

  - input: "1001-ai-learned-pattern.mdc"
    output: "Valid AI created rule"
    explanation: "Proper category (1000+), indicates AI learning"

  - input: "invalid_rule.mdc"
    output: "Invalid: Missing category prefix and using underscores"
    explanation: "Must start with category number and use hyphens"

  - input: "042--double-hyphen.mdc"
    output: "Invalid: Contains consecutive hyphens"
    explanation: "Hyphens must be single and separate words"

  - input: "999-wrong-category.mdc"
    output: "Invalid: Category 999 is not in defined ranges"
    explanation: "Must use defined category ranges"
