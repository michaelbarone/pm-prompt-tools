# Memory Management System

<rule>
name: memory_knowledge_management
description: Comprehensive system for managing documentation memory and maintaining project knowledge

## CRITICAL REMINDER

REMEMBER: My memory resets completely between sessions. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on the /docs files to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read /docs/working-memory/plan.md at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional.
REMEMBER: if you dont know the answer, say so and get help from the user.  If you need more information, say so and get help from the user.
REMEMBER: Make the fewest changes to the code for the desired outcome.  Do not change code that is not required for the current task without asking and clarifying why changes are requested.

## Cross-Rule Dependencies

This rule focuses on HOW to maintain documentation and manage memory. For guidance on problem-solving approaches and what to document during planning, refer to:
- [011-docs-plan-management.mdc] - Problem analysis, solution design, and implementation planning
  - Use for task planning structure
  - Follow for problem-solving methodology
  - Reference for milestone management

- [012-docs-template-generation.mdc] - Use of templates for Document generation
  - Follow document structure guidelines
  - Promting questions based on templates for easy creation and improvement to business documents
  - Checks, considerations, and best practices for document generation

## Rule Integration Guidelines

### Problem-Solving Integration

When addressing problems, this rule should be used in conjunction with [011-docs-plan-management.mdc]:

1. Memory Management During Problem-Solving:
   - Document all findings in working memory
   - Update project memory with solutions
   - Maintain cross-references between related issues
   - Track knowledge gained for future reference

2. Documentation Integration:
   - Follow problem-solving templates from [docs-plan-management]
   - Maintain memory management standards from this rule
   - Ensure proper cross-referencing between both
   - Keep documentation synchronized

### Implementation Planning Integration

When planning implementations, coordinate between rules:

1. Memory Aspects (This Rule):
   - How to document
   - Where to store information
   - When to update documentation
   - How to maintain cross-references

2. Planning Aspects ([docs-plan-management]):
   - What to document
   - Which templates to use
   - What questions to ask
   - How to structure the plan

### Documentation Planning Integration

When planning documentation updates:

1. Memory Management (This Rule):
   - Documentation location strategy
   - Update frequency requirements
   - Cross-reference maintenance
   - Version tracking approach

2. Planning Structure ([docs-plan-management]):
   - Documentation content structure
   - Required sections and fields
   - Question protocols
   - Review processes

## Essential Rules

1. Personalization:
   - Always refer to the User Rules for User Preferences and Local Environment Specifics

2. Memory Reset Protocol:
   - Complete memory reset between sessions
   - All context must come from /docs
   - Mandatory plan.md review before tasks
   - Mandatory plan.md update during and after tasks
   - No assumptions about previous state

3. Directory Structure:
   ```
   /docs/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ working-memory/           # Active context
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ open/                # Active tasks
   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {task-id}/      # Task-specific directory
   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .plan       # Task planning and updates
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ done/               # Completed tasks
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ plan.md             # Main project plan
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/              # document templates with [type]-template.md naming scheme
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ output/              # document output
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-context.md     # Tech stack, directory structure, and project best practices
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cursor_settings.md     # IDE settings
   ```

4. File Management:
   - Be very cautious when deleting files
   - Only delete relevant files
   - Ask for permission if unsure about deletions
   - Before commits with large deletions, review and confirm necessity

5. Code Changes:
   - Make surgical fixes to existing functionality
   - Only change what's necessary to resolve immediate issues
   - DO NOT REFACTOR code without clarifying or being asked directly
   - Review several options to fultill the current task before moving forward with the option that requires the least amount of code changes
   - Before creating new components, check for existing components first

## Development Requirements

1. Focus and Clarity:
   - Focus only on task-related changes
   - Follow direct user instructions
   - Clarify when needed
   - Seek multiple solutions
   - Ask for input when uncertain
   - DO NOT change style, position of ui elements unless instructed to in the current task

2. Code Standards:
   - Follow current frameworks and patterns
   - Keep code DRY
   - Follow SOLID principles
   - Fully implement requested functionality
   - No TODOs or placeholders
   - Follow linting rules
   - Make minimal changes for the current task

3. Documentation First:
   - Update documentation before code changes
   - Maintain real-time progress tracking
   - Ensure cross-reference accuracy

4. Task Management:
   - Create task directories using templates in the /docs/working-memory directory structure
   - Track progress in task .plan
   - Task Completion Checklist (ALL steps required):
     1. Move task directory:
        ```powershell
        Move-Item "docs/working-memory/open/${task-name}" "docs/working-memory/done/"
        ```
        ```bash
        mv "docs/working-memory/open/${task-name}" "docs/working-memory/done/"
        ```
     2. Update plan.md:
        - Remove task from "Active Tasks" section
        - Add task to "Closed Tasks" section with:
          - Location (updated to /done/ path)
          - Completion Date
          - Description
          - Key Achievements
     3. Verify all related tasks:
        - Check if this task was blocking other tasks
        - Update status of dependent tasks
        - Move any completed subtasks to done
   - ALWAYS Update main plan.md links when anything changes in active or done

    * @description Handles user authentication through form submission
    *
    * @example
    * ```tsx
    * <LoginForm
    *   onSuccess={handleSuccess}
    *   redirectPath="/dashboard"
    * />
    * ```
    */
   interface LoginFormProps {
     /** Callback fired when login succeeds */
     onSuccess: (user: User) => void;
     /** Path to redirect after successful login */
     redirectPath?: string;
   }
   ```

2. State Management Documentation:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Authentication State
    * @typedef {Object} AuthState
    *
    * @example
    * ```tsx
    * const [authState, dispatch] = useReducer(authReducer, initialState);
    * ```
    */
   interface AuthState {
     /** Current user object, null if not authenticated */
     user: User | null;
     /** Loading state for auth operations */
