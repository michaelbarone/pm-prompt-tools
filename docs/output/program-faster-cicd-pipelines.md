# Program Proposal: Faster CICD Pipelines

*Updated: 2024-03-26 23:15*

## Initial Prompt

### Program Name
Faster CICD Pipelines

### Elevator Pitch
We need to optimize our build, lint, testing, and deployment scripts to boost developer productivity and ship critical fixes faster. Right now, PR pipelines take 15-25 minutes, deployments up to 15 minutes, and local development tasks are sluggish‚Äîdelaying hotfixes that could be stopping financial loss or data corruption. It's 2025‚Äîwe can and should do better.

## Problem Statement

### Current Problem
Our current CICD pipeline performance is creating significant bottlenecks in our development workflow and impacting our ability to respond quickly to critical issues. The key pain points include:

- PR pipelines taking 15-25 minutes, slowing down code review cycles and feature delivery
- Deployment processes requiring up to 15 minutes, delaying critical hotfixes
- Sluggish local development tasks reducing developer productivity
- Extended pipeline times increasing the risk window for critical issues like financial loss or data corruption
- Developer time being wasted waiting for builds and tests to complete

This situation is particularly problematic when we need to deploy urgent fixes for issues that could be causing financial loss or data corruption. In 2025, with modern tooling and infrastructure available, these pipeline times are unacceptable and represent a clear opportunity for optimization.

## Objectives and Success Metrics

### External Beneficiary Objectives
- [X] Faster delivery of critical fixes and features to customers (with minimal user-facing impact)
- [X] Reduced system vulnerability windows during deployments (backend improvement)
- [ ] More frequent and reliable feature releases

### Internal Beneficiary Objectives
- [X] Reduce PR pipeline execution time by at least 50%
- [X] Cut deployment time to under 5 minutes
- [X] Improve local development task performance by 40%

### Key Results (Success Metrics)

   - Priority: HIGH - Critical for incident response

3. Improve local development task completion time by 40% by Q3 2025
   - Milestone 1: 20% improvement by Q2 2025
   - Milestone 2: Full improvement by end of Q3 2025
   - Priority: MEDIUM - Important but less critical than pipeline speeds

4. Achieve 99.9% pipeline reliability rate by Q3 2025
   - Milestone 1: 99.5% by Q2 2025
   - Milestone 2: 99.9% by end of Q3 2025
