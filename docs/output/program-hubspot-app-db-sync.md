# Program Proposal: Hubspot <> App DB Sync

*Updated: 2025-03-26 16:08*

## Initial Prompt

### Program Name
Hubspot <> App DB Sync

### Elevator Pitch
We use Hubspot as our CRM, and separately our ISA to input data for the application to be used by customers. By establishing Hubspot as the single source of truth with automated database synchronization, we can eliminate manual data entry errors, reduce duplicate work, and ensure consistent, up-to-date records across systems. This will prevent issues like continued system access after account churn and improve overall data accuracy.

## Problem Statement

### Current Problem
Currently, our organization maintains two separate systems for managing customer data: Hubspot CRM and our internal ISA application database. This dual-system approach creates several critical issues:

1. Manual Data Entry Redundancy: Staff must input the same information in multiple places, leading to:
   - Increased workload and time consumption
   - Higher risk of data entry errors
   - Inconsistencies between systems

2. Data Synchronization Challenges:
   - Customer updates in one system may not be reflected in the other
   - Risk of outdated information leading to business decisions based on incorrect data
   - Critical issues like continued system access after account churn due to missed updates

## Objectives and Success Metrics

### External Beneficiary Objectives
- Objective 1: Ensure customers have accurate, up-to-date access levels based on their current account status
- Objective 2: Reduce response time for account changes and updates
- Objective 3: Improve overall service quality through accurate data management

### Internal Beneficiary Objectives
- Objective 1: Eliminate duplicate data entry work for operations team
- Objective 2: Reduce time spent on manual data synchronization
- Objective 3: Minimize risk of errors in customer data management

### Key Results (Success Metrics)
1. Reduce manual data entry time by 90% within 3 months of implementation
2. Achieve 100% data consistency between Hubspot and App database within 1 month of implementation
3. Reduce customer access-related incidents due to outdated data by 100% within 2 months

## Solution Planning

### Possible Solutions

#### Solution 1: Real-time Bi-directional Sync
- Description: Implement a real-time synchronization system between Hubspot and the App database
- Pros: 
  - Immediate data consistency
  - No manual intervention needed
  - Reduced risk of errors
- Cons: 
  - More complex implementation
  - Requires careful conflict resolution handling
  - Higher initial development effort
- Estimated Effort: High

#### Solution 2: Scheduled One-way Sync (Hubspot to App)
- Description: Implement a scheduled job that syncs data from Hubspot to the App database at regular intervals
- Pros:
  - Simpler implementation
  - Clear source of truth
  - Lower development complexity
- Cons:
  - Not real-time
  - Potential for temporary data inconsistency
  - Limited flexibility
- Estimated Effort: Medium

## Risk Assessment

### Assumptions and Validations

#### Market Viability
- Assumption: The time saved on manual data entry will justify the development investment
- Validation: Calculate current time spent on manual updates and multiply by average hourly rate
- Confidence: High

#### User Desirability
- Assumption: Operations team will prefer automated sync over manual updates
- Validation: Interview operations team members about current pain points and proposed solution
- Confidence: High

#### Technical Feasibility
- Assumption: Hubspot API provides all necessary data points for synchronization
- Validation: Review Hubspot API documentation and test key endpoints
- Confidence: Medium

#### Operational Impact
- Build Cost: Medium - Requires dedicated development team for 1-2 months
- Maintenance Cost: Low - Once established, system should require minimal maintenance
- Resource Requirements:
  - Backend developer for API integration
  - Database administrator for schema alignment
  - Operations team for testing and validation
  - Project manager for coordination
