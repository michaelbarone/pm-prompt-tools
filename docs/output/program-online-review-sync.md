# Program Proposal Template

*Updated: 2025-04-02 14:31*

## Initial Prompt

### Program Name
Online-Review-Sync (formerly "The Scraper")

### Elevator Pitch
```
A critical modernization initiative to rebuild our core Online Review Synchronization system, which currently processes over 125,000 reviews monthly and facilitates employee bonus payouts. The modernization leverages current best practices and automated deployment strategies, enabling dynamic scaling capabilities while reducing security risks and the current bus factor associated with this critical system.

## Problem Statement

### Current Problem
```
The current "Scraper" system, while being a core value offering processing over 125,000 reviews monthly and managing approximately $200,000 in monthly employee earnings resulting in $120,000 of payouts each month, has accumulated significant technical debt over its 5-year lifespan. The system faces several critical issues that impact both operational efficiency and business value:

1. Infrastructure Challenges:
   - Outdated EC2 instances requiring OS updates, with 6 instances >180 days without updates
   - Manual deployments across 6 EC2 nodes, requiring ~.5 hours per deployment
   - Limited scaling capabilities leading to processing backlogs during high-volume periods
   - Deferred maintenance on underlying infrastructure
   - Currently deployed to our legacy AWS account with reduced security controls

2. Codebase Issues:
   - Accumulated technical debt requiring increased engineering time for maintenance
   - Multiple bandaid fixes make continued maintenance more difficult
   - Outdated dependencies with known security vulnerabilities
   - Limited logging visibility and alerting leading to average under 12 hour incident detection time
   - Manual deployment process limitations slows down the abilty to ship fixes and improvements when needed

3. Usability Issues:
   - Engineering Support team spends ~1 hours weekly on manual review sync requests
   - Current privileged access requirements pose security audit concerns
   - Average response time of 24-72+ hours for manual sync requests impacts customer satisfaction
   - No self-service capabilities for urgent review sync needs

These issues pose significant risks to system reliability and maintainability, while also limiting our ability to efficiently scale and manage the service based on demand. The current system's limitations directly impact customer satisfaction and employee bonus processing timeliness.

## Objectives and Success Metrics

### External Beneficiary Objectives
- Objective 1: Improved system reliability and performance for review synchronization
- Objective 2: Faster processing of reviews and bonus matching
- Objective 3: More consistent and reliable service availability

### Internal Beneficiary Objectives
- Objective 1: Eliminate manual deployment processes across EC2 nodes
- Objective 2: Enable automated scaling based on demand
- Objective 3: Improve system observability through enhanced logging and alerting
- Objective 4: Reduce maintenance overhead through improved coding standards and deployment practices

### Key Results (Success Metrics)
1. [Migration Completion: Successfully migrate all functionality to new codebase and infrastructure within defined timeline]
2. [Deployment Automation: Reduce deployment time from manual process to <15 minutes through automation]
3. [System Reliability: Achieve 99.9% system uptime, and establish alerting for system irregularities for more active resolution to issues]
4. [Scalability: Implement auto-scaling capabilities with defined thresholds]
5. [Usability: Implement ability to trigger re-scrape/jump the line for locations without needing engineering time]

## Solution Planning

### Possible Solutions

#### Solution 1: Complete System Modernization
- Description: Full migration to new repository with modern architecture and automated deployments
- Pros:
  * Leverages existing company best practices
  * Enables automated deployments
  * Improves security through better AWS account structure
  * Allows for automated scaling
  * Clean slate for improved code organization
- Cons:
  * Requires significant initial development effort (base reposity function already established)
  * Need careful testing to ensure feature parity

#### Solution 2: Slow Migration to Modern System
- Description: Gradual modernization while maintaining existing system
- Pros:
  * Lower initial risk
  * Can modernize in phases
  * Allows for gradual testing and validation
- Cons:
  * Longer overall timeline
  * Need to maintain two systems longer
  * More complex coordination required
  * Still need to address immediate infrastructure and alerting needs
  * Any issues that come up will need to be solved in 2 places
  * Does not realize any near term benefits without duplicated work (adding alerting to old system, then again to modernized system)

#### Solution 3: Maintain Existing System
- Description: Continue with current codebase and infrastructure, addressing issues through incremental fixes
- Pros:
  * No immediate development investment required
  * Familiar system for current team
  * No migration risks
- Cons:
  * Technical debt continues to compound
  * Manual deployments and processes remain
  * Security vulnerabilities increase over time
  * No improvement to scaling capabilities
  * Engineering time continues to be wasted on manual tasks
  * Engineering continues to require direct database access
  * System reliability may deteriorate
  * Bus factor remains a significant risk
  * Limited monitoring and alerting capabilities
  * Increasing maintenance costs over time
  * Higher operational costs due to inefficient resource usage
  * Reduced ability to adapt to changing business needs

## Risk Assessment

### Assumptions and Validations

#### Market Viability
- Assumption: The modernized system will maintain or improve current review processing capabilities
- Validation: Comprehensive testing of new system against current functionality
- Confidence: High

#### User Desirability
- Assumption: Users will benefit from improved reliability and faster processing
- Validation: Monitor system performance metrics and user feedback
- Confidence: High

#### Technical Feasibility
- Assumption: Current best practices and deployment strategies will work for this service
- Validation: Early proof-of-concept deployment using new infrastructure
- Confidence: High

#### Operational Impact
- Build Cost: Medium - Requires dedicated engineering team for migration
- Maintenance Cost: Low (post-migration) - Automated processes reduce ongoing maintenance
- Resource Requirements:
  * Development team for migration
  * DevOps support for infrastructure setup
  * QA resources for testing
