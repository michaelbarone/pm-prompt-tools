## Initial Prompt

### Program Name
Online-Review-Sync (formerly "The Scraper")

### Elevator Pitch
```
An innovative enhancement to our Online Review Synchronization system that will revolutionize how we onboard and support customers. This initiative will empower Customer Success teams with self-service capabilities, dramatically reduce review sync delays from 24+ hours to minutes for new locations, and eliminate manual engineering interventions. With our current online review sync system processing over 125,000 reviews monthly and enabling $200,000 in monthly employee earnings, this modernization will transform our customer onboarding experience and strengthen customer confidence in our platform's capabilities.

## Problem Statement

### Current Problem
```
Our Online Review Synchronization system, while processing over 125,000 reviews monthly and managing $200,000 in monthly employee earnings, presents several opportunities for innovation and customer experience enhancement:

1. Customer Success Empowerment Needs:
   - CS team lacks self-service capabilities for review sync management
   - Manual sync requests require engineering tickets, taking 24-72 hours to resolve
   - 2-6 weekly sync requests require unnecessary engineering involvement
   - New location onboarding experience impacted by sync delays
   - Customer confidence affected during onboarding calls due to data inconsistencies

2. New Location Experience Gaps:
   - New locations (100-200 monthly) wait up to 24 hours for initial review sync
   - Queue system delays prevent immediate data availability for new locations
   - Onboarding calls often conducted without complete review data
   - Customer trust impacted when platform data doesn't match online sources
   - Manual intervention required for expedited syncs

3. System Enhancement Opportunities:
   - Lack of immediate sync capabilities for urgent customer needs
   - No prioritization system for new location syncs
   - Limited visibility into sync status and issues
   - Manual processes creating unnecessary delays
   - Customer confidence impacted by data synchronization delays

These limitations affect our ability to deliver an optimal customer experience, particularly during crucial onboarding phases, potentially contributing to customer churn when platform data doesn't align with their expectations.
